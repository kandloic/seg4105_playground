# Diving Into the World fo Shape Up

## Chapter 2 - Principles of Shaping
- **Shaping** is the concept of defining work to be done over a defined cycle.
  - Not too vague (words)
  - Not too concrete (wireframes)

- Properties of good shaped work:
  - **Rough:** Everyone can see the open spaces where their contributions will go
  - **Solved:** All the main elements of the solution are there at the macro level and they connect together
  - **Bound:**  Indicates what not to do

- Steps to shaping:
  - Set boundaries
  - Rough out the elements
  - Address risks and rabbit holes
  - Write the pitch

## Chapter 3 - Set Boundaries
Discussion on what NOT to do! Focus on:
- **Setting appetite**: How much work do we want to / should we chew?
- **Fixed time, variable scope** principle should be applied at every step of the process
  - Example: When writing a book, with one week left to publish, I can choose between fixing typos or adding a new section section to a chapter. It is better to scope down to make the deadline
- **Good is relative** to constraints, and other circumstances
- **Response to new ideas** should be a soft no that leaves all options open and rather assess its priority / urgency
- **Narrow down the problem** by asking "*What is wrong?*" instead of "*What could we build?*"
- **Watch out for grab-bags** which are solutions that do not address the problem / use case

## Chapter 4 - Find the Elements
Now that we have the constraints of an appetite and the problem we’re solving, it’s time to get
from an idea in words to the elements of a software solution.

Keep in mind to:
- **Move at the right speed** by working with the right people and using the correct level of detail
  - Questions to answer:
    - Where in the current system does the new thing fit?
    - How do you get to it?
    - What are the key components or interactions?
    - Where does it take you?
- **Breadboard(ing)** by drawing illustrations of the solution. Include:
  - Places (Screens)
  - Affordance (What can I do)
  - Connection lines (How can I go to B from here)

## Chapter 5 - Risks and Rabbit Holes
Look critically at what we came up with!

LOOK OUT FOR:
- Known unknowns and unknown unknowns. These could seriously delay the project by a lot.
  - Goal is to increase probability that work will take as long as planned
- Rabbit holes:
  - Unfair technical assumptions

Mitigations:
- Walk through use case in slow-mo and assess viability of each part we think we solved
  - Guiding questions:
    - Does this require new technical work we’ve never done before?
    - Are we making assumptions about how the parts fit together?
    - Are we assuming a design solution exists that we couldn’t come up with ourselves?
    - Is there a hard decision we should settle in advance so it doesn’t trip up the team?
