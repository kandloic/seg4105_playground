In this [podcast episode](https://37signals.com/podcast/writing-a-pitch/), the hosts, Kimberly Rhodes, Jason Fried, and David Heinermeier Hansson, discuss the central concept of "pitches" within 37signals' Shape Up product development methodology. Pitches are directional documents used to propose and outline new features or projects. They are not detailed specifications but provide an idea of what needs to be done, why it's important, and some initial thoughts on how to solve the problem. Pitches are typically around 800 words and are handed to a team responsible for turning them into actual work. It typically includes:

- **Problem Definition:** Pitches start by defining the problem that needs solving, ensuring alignment with customer needs or business goals.
- **Appetite:** They set boundaries, specifying the resources, time, and effort available for the project to prevent scope creep.
- **Solution Approach:** While not a detailed specification, pitches outline a preliminary solution or approach.
- **Rabbit Holes:** The concept of "rabbit holes" is discussed as elements that may be enticing but could lead to complexity and delays, emphasizing the need to recognize and avoid them.
- **No-Gos:** Some pitches include "no-gos" to clearly define what will not be addressed, maintaining project focus.
- **Science Projects:** Projects with high uncertainty are acknowledged as "science projects," requiring special attention due to their challenging nature.
- **Tracer Bullets:** Tracer bullets, or exploratory efforts, assess the feasibility of a project before full commitment, aiding in decision-making.

Anyone within the company can suggest ideas, but formalized pitches, determining project priorities, are typically written by decision-making individuals or teams. Pitches should be sufficiently detailed to provide direction while allowing flexibility for creative solutions during implementation.

the podcast also highlights that when employees have the freedom to make decisions, opportunities to become experts in their work, and a sense of purpose, they tend to be happier and more productive. It's like giving them the keys to drive their own projects.

Additionally, the podcast underlines that it's not just about knowing what to work on, but also recognizing what not to get distracted by. This helps teams stay focused on their main goals and objectives, which is essential for successful project outcomes.
