# Show Progress

The "Show Progress" chapter in Ryan Singer's "Shape Up" emphasizes the importance of demonstrating visible progress throughout the project, both to maintain team morale and to build trust with stakeholders.

## The tasks that aren't there

In this section, Ryan Singer discusses the significance of acknowledging the absence of certain tasks in project planning. He emphasizes that sometimes it's equally crucial to recognize what tasks are not included in a project plan. Understanding what is intentionally left out helps in setting the right priorities and managing expectations effectively.

## Estimates don't show uncertainty

Singer highlights that project estimates often fail to account for uncertainty. Even the most meticulously calculated estimates are subject to variability. Teams should be aware that estimates are not precise predictions but rather rough approximations, and they should be prepared to adapt when uncertainties arise.

## Work is like a hill

Singer uses the metaphor of work being like a hill to illustrate that not all tasks are equal in terms of effort and complexity. Some tasks are small and manageable, while others are more challenging and time-consuming. Recognizing this, teams can organize and tackle work more effectively, prioritizing the most critical and manageable tasks first.

## Scopes on the hill

This section delves into the idea that work can be visualized as scopes distributed on the metaphorical "hill" of tasks. Scopes represent different pieces of work with varying complexities. By understanding the distribution of scopes on the hill, teams can make informed decisions about where to begin and how to approach different aspects of a project.

## Status without asking

Singer emphasizes the importance of teams being able to gauge the status of a project without the need for constant inquiry or reporting. Clear and visible progress and status indicators should be readily available and accessible to everyone involved, creating transparency and reducing the need for constant status updates.

## Nobody says "I don't know"

Singer addresses the tendency for team members to avoid saying "I don't know" when they encounter uncertainty or challenges. He advocates for creating a culture where it's acceptable to admit not knowing something and where uncertainty is seen as an opportunity to learn and explore.

## Prompts to refactor the scopes

This section discusses the importance of regularly reviewing and refining the scopes of work. Teams should be open to revisiting and refactoring scopes based on new information or changing project requirements. This adaptability helps in maintaining a clear and effective project plan.

## Build your way uphill

Singer suggests that the best way to approach a project is to "build your way uphill." Start with the most manageable and foundational tasks, and gradually tackle more complex and challenging aspects. This iterative approach ensures that the project progresses smoothly and that the team is continually building on a solid foundation.

## Solve in the right sequence

Singer emphasizes the significance of solving problems and addressing tasks in the right sequence. Some tasks are dependent on others, and tackling them in the correct order ensures efficient progress. Sequencing is essential for avoiding bottlenecks and optimizing the development process.
